Base is a general purpose library providing a number of the basic needs of most apps, suitable as the beginnings of a project. Base covers:
- Logging
- Network reachability
- Networking
- CoreData storage
- Outline coordination (flow control) support
- Auto-layout convenience
- Support for networked test data supply

The primary goal of Base is the creation of a standardised, but flexible, networking model based on the separation of resources from the execution of the collection and decoding of those resources.
